#FLTK/GUI Starter Programming  We start an elementary FLTK/GUI programming. To complete this assignment, your must complete FLTK/GUI installation and read textbook Chapter 12 and 13. The sample code that can be downloaded at the textbook site (go here and click "Complete collection of code fragments") is useful for testing and augmenting to more complex applications.  Generate three squares of a given line length read from user input and place them into random positions. The points in a X-Y coordinate system in which the origin [0, 0] is a left upper corner of a window, and the X and Y coordinate expresses distances from the origin to X and Y, in which the coordinate unit defined for the FLTK/GUI window is a pixel like most other graphic interfaces. You can choose any window size but go with larger than 500 x 500 pixels for better visibility. Those generated squares must be fit in your window.   The overlapped part (called an intersection) of any of the two squares must be shown clearly, e.g., squares are shown by dark-red color and intersections are shown by white color. The program keeps reading the positive number for the line length (which should be less than your window size) and keep generating the squares until it reads 0 or negative value. Note that your program may show some garbage shape(s) unless all the attached shapes are detached before the next cycle of window manipulation.
